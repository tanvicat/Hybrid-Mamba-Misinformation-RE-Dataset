Fear-mongering Facebook memes misrepresented the position articulated by the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in a speech in July 2020.,0
"In July and August, Facebook users shared posts that contained the following text:",0
One academic has helpfully summed up that philosophical conflict as follows:,0
"Shareholder theory asserts that shareholders advance capital to a companys managers, who are supposed to spend corporate funds only in ways that have been authorized by the shareholders. As Milton Friedman wrote, ""There is one and only one social responsibility of business  to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it  engages in open and free competition, without deception or fraud.""",0

Technically the calculation is actually 133 percent under the law, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that.",0
"Did 50,000 'Freedom Convoy' Trucks Set Guinness World Record?",0
The vast majority of truck drivers in Canada are vaccinated.,0
"In January 2022, a number of trucks participated in a convoy across Canada to protest the country's requirement for cross-border truckers to be vaccinated for COVID-19. As videos of the so-called ""freedom convoy"" spread on social media, various claims emerged regarding the number of trucks involved in this event. These claims ranged from a few hundred to more than 50,000. Some even asserted that the freedom convoy had set a Guinness World Record for the largest truck convoy. As of this writing, the freedom convoy has not earned a place in the Guinness World Records book. Furthermore, the claim that this convoy involved 50,000 trucks appears to be a gross exaggeration that contradicts all available evidence. The largest truck convoy on record was set in November 2020 in Cairo, Egypt. That convoy involved 480 trucks and stretched 7.5 km (4.6 miles). Guinness states: ""The largest parade of trucks consisted of 480 trucks and was achieved by Tahya Misr Fund (Egypt), in Cairo, Egypt, on 20 November 2020. With a length of 7.5 km, Tahya Misr Fund was able to organize a parade of 480 trucks amid harsh weather and heavy rain, breaking the Guinness World Records title for the largest parade of trucks, which was achieved 16 years ago in the Netherlands with a parade size of 416 trucks; thus, the Tahya Misr Fund became the new record holder."" This Guinness World Records entry provides a data point that makes us skeptical of the 50,000 truck claim. If a 480 truck convoy stretched 7.5 km, a 50,000 truck convoy would stretch 750 km (about 460 miles). We have seen no evidence to support the idea that the freedom convoy is anywhere near 460 miles long. So just how many trucks participated in this freedom convoy? There's no official count for the number of trucks involved. Estimates are also difficult because this big rig convoy includes a number of cars and other smaller vehicles. Furthermore, the ""freedom convoy"" has been a multi-day event, and some trucks may only participate for a portion of the journey. These variables make it challenging to estimate the number of trucks involved. We reached out to the Canadian Trucking Alliance for more information and will update this article if more information becomes available. Many Canadian news outlets have used the word ""hundreds"" to quantify the number of trucks in this convoy. The CBC, for example, reported: ""Hundreds of truckers set off from British Columbia to Ottawa on Sunday to protest a federal vaccine mandate despite the urging of the country's largest trucking federation to comply."" Adrian Ghobrial, a reporter for the Toronto news outlet City News, stated that while thousands of people have come out to watch and support the truckers as they drive by, he was skeptical that the convoy consisted of more than 100 trucks. David Akin, the chief global correspondent with Global News, cited a report from the Ontario Provincial Police that recorded 113 trucks (as well as 276 personal vehicles) coming into Thunder Bay from Winnipeg. On social media, the estimate of trucks involved in this convoy has grown with each tweet. A post from Fox News host Sean Hannity, for example, claimed that the freedom convoy consisted of 10,000 trucks. Others claimed that this number exceeded 50,000 trucks. The claim that 50,000 trucks are participating in this convoy appears to have originated with one of the protest's organizers. However, the organizers may not be the most reliable source for this figure, as they have reason to inflate these numbers. The number also seems implausible given what we know about the trucking industry in Canada. According to the Canadian Trucking Alliance, the cross-border vaccine mandate would impact about 15% (or about 16,000) of the country's truckers. If the 50,000 truck claim is to be believed, that would mean that not only would every one of those 16,000 truckers have to participate in the event, but they would also need to be joined by 34,000 additional trucks who weren't impacted by the mandate. The Canadian Trucking Alliance stated that ""the vast majority of the Canadian trucking industry is vaccinated, with the overall industry vaccination rate among truck drivers closely mirroring that of the general public. Accordingly, most of our nation's hard-working truck drivers are continuing to move cross-border and domestic freight to ensure our economy continues to function.""",0

Did Immigration Enforcement Agents Arrest the Mayor of Los Angeles?,0
A routine review of content labeled satire.,0
"On Nov. 26, Taters Gonna Tate published an article positing that the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had arrested the mayor of Los Angeles, titled ""ICE Arrests LA Mayor for Harboring Fugitives Through Sanctuary City."" We've all been wondering when this would happen and why it wasn't done from the start. But we shouldn't dwell; justice is finally being served. Josiah Barron, the celebrated mayor of Los Angeles County, was led away from his office in handcuffs today by ICE agents and charged with harboring fugitives from the law due to his decision to provide undocumented immigrants with refuge under his Sanctuary City designation. The arrest followed Barron's order to the city's police to not cooperate with ICE by reporting illegal aliens in their custody. ICE demanded that the criminals be handed over, but they were denied. This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated from a website that describes its output as humorous or satirical in nature, stating: ""Tatersgonnatate.com is a subsidiary of the Americas Last Line of Defense network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery ... Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental, and all images should be considered altered and satirical."" The fake story was widely shared in late December after America's Last Line of Defense (ALLOD) re-promoted it on Facebook on Dec. 24. Although the article bore disclaimers labeling it ""satire,"" many readers mistook it for serious news, as demonstrated by a series of earnest comments on the ALLOD Facebook page. For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire and humor.",0

Did Channing Tatum Come Out as Gay?,0
Fake news of no redeeming value is often generated by prank news sites and formatted for social media impact.,0
"On 28 May 2015, a news-like link began to circulate on Facebook claiming that popular actor Channing Tatum had come out as gay. The link's headline stated, ""Channing Tatum comes out as Gay,"" and the preview text read, ""Channing Tatum comes out as Gay following a number of rumours."" While the rumor briefly gained popularity on sites like Twitter and Facebook among Tatum's fans, it was generated by the site Feednewz.com. Feednewz.com is not a news site; rather, its primary purpose is the generation of user-submitted links that appear to be news stories. Similar to a viral hoax involving EastEnders actor Danny Dyer, the Channing Tatum hoax spread unusually far for a Feednewz.com link due to user interest in the fabricated claim. Claims like the one about Tatum often spread due to a compelling headline alone. Readers who clicked through to the appended link were greeted with an image revealing the prank: Channing Tatum did not disclose any new information about his sexuality and remained married to actress Jenna Dewan until they separated in March 2018.",0

Is Amazon Giving Away Free AirPods in a Raffle?,0
"If you receive this congratulatory text message from ""Amazon"" on your phone, don't click that link!",0
"If you received a text message purportedly from Amazon, chances are you are one of many recipients, and it is a scam. During March and April 2021, many Snopes readers reported receiving messages on their phones claiming they had won an AirPod or another device in a raffle. One of our editors also received a message that said: ""Amazon: Congratulations Bond, you came second in this week's Amazon pods raffle! Follow this link to [...]"" She did not follow that link, however, as it immediately appeared to be a scam. Indeed, the link did not connect to an official Amazon webpage. According to Amazon, all of its web pages typically follow the same format, ending in amazon.com, for example: pay.amazon.com or aws.amazon.com. Any link that is an IP address or a random string of numbers should be viewed with suspicion. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) alerted users to this scam back in March, warning that if you receive a text message from a range of unknown numbers with a suspicious link for collecting your item, you should not click! The text message is not from Amazon and is the latest in a long list of impersonation scams that have emerged since the start of the pandemic, often using Amazon's brand. The bogus raffle and suspicious link are part of a con designed to trick people into visiting a phishing website, where they unwittingly share account credentials as well as personal and financial information with fraudsters. According to Amazon, any customer who receives a questionable email, text, or call from someone impersonating Amazon or an Amazon employee should report it to Amazon customer service. Amazon investigates these complaints and will take action if warranted. You can submit suspicious information to stop-spoofing@amazon.com. Amazon also offers a page to help identify whether an email, text, or phone call is genuinely from Amazon. The BBB also included a screenshot of a message similar to the one received by our editor, except the recipient was informed that they came third in the raffle. When our editor reported the number that texted her to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it recommended several tips to block spam messages. Given that the link to collecting the so-called prize does not direct users to an official Amazon website and could potentially compromise private information, we rate this claim a scam.",0

Did Trump Refer to 'China Virus' on Fox the Night Asian Women Were Killed in Atlanta?,0
The former president had called into Fox on March 16 to talk about issues unrelated to the Atlanta-area mass shooting.,0
"Around 5 p.m. EDT on March 16, 2021, a 21-year-old white man allegedly shot and killed eight people—six of whom were Asian women—at three Atlanta-area spas. As of this report, the investigation into the mass shooting remains ongoing. As word of the tragedy spread online, people flooded social media with messages of sympathy for the deceased. Many posts classified them as unknowing victims of the country's increasing xenophobia, given a surge of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., as well as pervasive violence against women. Among those posting was Aaron Rupar, a journalist at Vox. A couple of hours after the incident, for instance, he blamed former U.S. President Donald Trump's characterization of the coronavirus for the growing hate crimes against Asian Americans and tweeted: ""[I] don't think it's a coincidence that Trump spent the better part of a year using a virus as a slur against Chinese people while hate crimes against Asian Americans spiked by 150 percent."" Rupar was referring to Trump's repeated insistence on calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus,"" which goes against widely accepted public health guidelines that warn against titling disease outbreaks after nations or regions to eliminate stigmatization, as well as 2020 hate crime statistics in 16 U.S. cities compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. About 20 minutes later, Rupar added: As authorities in the Atlanta area embarked on a manhunt to catch the suspect on the evening of March 16, Trump referred to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"" on Fox News. But let this be clear: No evidence explicitly connected the former president's use of the term on national television with the tragedy unfolding simultaneously in Georgia. Furthermore, it was unclear whether he was even aware of the mass shooting when he said ""China virus"" while discussing unrelated matters—specifically, his presidential administration's approach to the American economy. The interviewer did not ask him about the Atlanta-area shooting. Here's what happened: Between roughly 6 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. EDT, according to The Associated Press, the victims' bodies were reported inside massage parlors, and authorities arrested the suspected gunman—Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia—as he was driving on the interstate. Meanwhile, at 7 p.m. EDT, Trump called in for a phone interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, a recording of which Snopes obtained via the media outlet's website and is displayed below. Throughout much of the interview, the former president lambasted his successor's approach to immigration, criticized election security, and took credit for the ongoing efforts to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to every American willing to get one. Then, at approximately the 5-minute mark, he said: ""[The economy] was recovering under my administration—twice. We got it to a level that the world has never seen before. We were the envy of the world, and then when we got hit by the, as I call it, 'the China virus'—COVID—it obviously went down along with every other economy. And then we were the first to get it back up.""",0

Did Jimmy Carter participate in the building of low-cost housing despite encountering difficulties from an eye injury?,0
"For more than two years, fans of the president have circulated images and memes of the alleged incident.",0
"For years, liberal social media users have shared photographs or videos supposedly depicting former U.S. President Jimmy Carter doing woodworking with what appears to be an eye injury, apparently to emphasize that his age and medical history hadn't stopped him from volunteering. One Twitter user, for example, posted a meme about the 39th president in April 2022. A reverse-image search of the meme revealed numerous instances in which internet users promoted the underlying claim: that Carter, at age 95, fell, received stitches, and then the following day helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity, a Christian nonprofit that assists low-income families in building homes and paying their mortgages. The claim was true, though the incident had occurred more than two years prior, as of this writing. On Oct. 7, 2019, The Associated Press published the photographs featured in the meme, writing: ""NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville. Carter fell at home on Sunday, requiring 14 stitches, but he did not let his injuries keep him from participating in his 36th building project with the nonprofit Christian housing organization. He turned 95 last Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone."" The newspaper reported that he and his wife, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, worked that day on building corbels, a type of support bracket, for a home. CNN also reported on the public appearance, including the following quote from the former president in its Oct. 8, 2019, story: ""I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital. They took 14 stitches in my forehead, and my eye is black, as you've noticed,"" he said. ""But I had a No. 1 priority, and that was to come to Nashville and build houses."" According to the nonprofit's website, the couple formed a partnership with Habitat for Humanity in the 1980s and have rallied ""thousands of volunteers and even celebrities"" to join the organization's cause since then. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Habitat for Humanity paused its so-called ""Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project,"" a recurring event during which the couple fundraises to build a grouping of homes.

They are listed in order of presidential term and include the following nuggets of information about Carter: Yes, Carter once helped contain a potentially dangerous accident at a nuclear reactor in Canada.

Hundreds of thousands of viewers liked the photo, and many who saw the above-displayed Instagram post believed it was written by Drake, while others noticed the musician's attempt to credit the original author and praised Mustafa the Poet for penning the viral phrase. However, the phrase ""If a writer falls in love with you, you can never die"" was written neither by Drake nor by Mustafa the Poet. The true author is Mik Everett, who first published the quote back in 2011 on her blog: Mik Everett blog. Lots of things might happen. That's the thing about writers. They're unpredictable. They might bring you eggs in bed for breakfast, or they might all but ignore you for days. They might bring you eggs in bed at three in the morning, or they might wake you up for sex at three in the morning, or make love at four in the afternoon. They might not sleep at all, or they might sleep right through the alarm and forget to get you up for work, or call you home from work to kill a spider, or refuse to speak to you after finding out you've never seen To Kill a Mockingbird, or spend the last of the rent money on five kinds of soap, or sell your textbooks for cash halfway through the semester, or leave you love notes in your pockets, or wash your pants with Post-It notes in the pockets so your laundry comes out covered in bits of wet paper. They might cry if the Post-It notes are unread all over your pants. It's an unpredictable life. But what happens if a writer falls in love with you? This is a little more predictable. You will find your hemp necklace with the glass mushroom pendant around the neck of someone at a bus stop in a short story. Your favorite shoes will mysteriously disappear and show up in a poem. The watch you always wear, the watch you own but never wear, the fact that you've never worn a watch: they suddenly belong to characters you've never known. And yet they're you. They're not you; they're someone else entirely, but they toss their hair like you. They use the same colloquialisms as you. They scratch their nose when they lie like you. Sometimes they will be narrators; sometimes protagonists, sometimes villains. Sometimes they will be nobodies, an unimportant, static prop. This might amuse you at first or confuse you. You might be bewildered when books turn into mirrors. You might try to see yourself as your beloved writer sees you when you read a poem about someone who has your middle name or prose about someone who has never seen To Kill a Mockingbird. These poems and novels and short stories will scatter into the wind. You will wonder if you're wandering through the pages of some story you've never even read. There's no way to know and no way to erase it. Even if you leave, a part of you will always be left behind. If a writer falls in love with you, you can never die. Vibe NY Mag On 23 January 2015, Mik Everett took to her website to express her frustrations with being a virally famous yet unknown author. A portion of Everett's article is republished below: website Last Monday, I woke up to something weirder than I could possibly imagine. I woke up to find that Drake had posted a quote by me on Instagram and that he'd credited the quote to another author. There is no Thought Catalog article entitled What to Do If a Famous Rapper Steals Your Quote. There is no Buzzfeed article on how to cope with the rabid fans of a rockstar insisting that you've stolen from him. To the best of my knowledge, this isn't a very common problem to have. Sure, I've heard of academic and artistic plagiarism before, usually involving two high-profile entertainment news celebrities. But I'm not a celebrity. I've sold, like, two hundred copies of each of my books. I live well below the poverty line. I'm a regular person who said something kinda catchy once on the internet, and lots of people liked it. And Drake liked it. I am so disconnected from that quote and the people who use it; I am simultaneously on the outside looking in on the very idea of fame and in the very middle of it. To be clear here, nobody broke any laws. Drake did not take credit for the quote. He attempted to cite the quote, like we all learned how to do in middle school. He just cited the wrong poet. That poet (he goes by Mustafa) did give me appropriate credit for the quote eventually. After Drake had reposted the quote and attributed it to Mustafa, I think it kinda blew up in his face, and people started hounding him to give me credit. And he did add my name in. But on the internet, that doesn't matter. Everyone else is still attributing the quote to Mustafa. And there's no way to fix it. Just try messaging Drake on Instagram. On one hand, it's not that big of a deal. The quote has been used several million times on the internet and is rarely credited to me. On the other hand, I would really, really, really like to make a living as an author. And in our day and age, there are no more camera-shy Thomas Pynchons. To be a financially successful author is inextricable from being a famous author. We hope this helps Mik Everett garner some of the recognition she deserves. Last updated: 10 February 2015.",0

Did Shane Patrick Boyle pass away due to his illness following successful fundraising for insulin via a crowdfunding campaign?,0
Reports concerning a man who passed away shortly after starting a GoFundMe crowdsourcing campaign to raise money for insulin were met with some skepticism.,0
"In February 2017, Shane Patrick Boyle started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for ""a month of insulin."" A few weeks later, he died after developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Although several local outlets reported on Boyle's death at the time, it wasn't until November 2017 that his story reached many readers, thanks in part to a Facebook post from United States Sen. Bernie Sanders linking to an article in The Nation about the rising cost of insulin. The post stated, ""We cannot call ourselves a great country as long as our young people are literally dying because they cannot afford life-saving medication."" This young man, Shane Patrick Boyle, died on March 18 after his GoFundMe campaign to pay for insulin came up $50 short. Something has got to change. Our job is to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and enact policies that make prescription drugs affordable for everyone—not ones that make the CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry rich. In addition to highlighting the sad circumstances surrounding Boyle's death, The Nation also pointed to Alec Raeshawn Smith, a 26-year-old who died in June after he lost his insurance and started to ration his insulin. Alec Raeshawn Smith, age 26, was found dead in his apartment on June 27. He was rationing his insulin after he aged out of his parents' insurance coverage. The sad fact is that more people would be alive today if insulin were affordable for all Americans. The deaths of Smith and Boyle and their reported struggles with health insurance were met with skepticism by some readers. Others encountered this news on social media, where it was shared with incomplete or incorrect information. For instance, comedian David Anthony conflated the deaths of these two individuals when he wrote that a 26-year-old had started a GoFundMe to get insulin: ""For the rest of my life, I will never forget a 26-year-old started a GoFundMe to get insulin, didn't get the amount he needed, and died rationing his not costly medicine. Just before Thanksgiving."" Alec Raeshawn Smith was 26 years old at the time of his death; however, we have not been able to find anything to indicate that he had set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for insulin. (A fundraiser was set up after his death to cover funeral costs.) Shane Patrick Boyle, on the other hand, was older when he died, and he did set up a fundraiser for medication. Smith passed away on June 27, 2017. In his obituary, his family asked for donations to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and encouraged everyone to sign a petition for affordable health care: ""In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be given to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, www.jdrf.org. We would also like to encourage everyone to go to www.jdrf.org and sign the Coverage 2 Control petition, which will provide affordability, choice, and coverage for people with diabetes."" Boyle died of the same treatable complication that killed Smith: diabetic ketoacidosis. Before his death on March 18, 2017, he set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for one month of insulin. The only archived version of this campaign is from March 23, 2017, five days after Boyle's death. Although this copy shows that Boyle had raised $1,590 of a $750 goal, it appears that the majority of this money was raised after his passing. (All eight comments were posted in the days following Boyle's death, and the visible donations, more than $200, were posted within a day of its archival date.) Ted Closson, a comic book artist and friend of Boyle's, wrote that Boyle was ""$50 shy of his goal"" for over two weeks. A second GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a memorial for Boyle and his mother also suggests that the fundraiser was short of the $750 goal at the time of Boyle's passing: ""The world lost a wonderful man due to complications of type 1 diabetes. My cousin, Shane Boyle, put everything into taking care of his ailing mother at the expense of his own needs. Shane's mother, Judy Boyle, passed away on March 11, and we lost Shane to diabetes exactly a week later on March 18. After his death, we learned that Shane lost his prescription benefits when he moved to Mena, Arkansas, to care for his mom. We found a GoFundMe where he was trying to raise $750 to get just one more month of insulin and supplies. Unfortunately, he didn't get help in time. Shane died because he was trying to stretch out his life-saving insulin to make it last longer. Shane was working hard to take care of his mother's funeral arrangements when he died. Her service had to be canceled because of the unexpected financial burden of losing two family members in a week's time. I am hoping we can raise the funds for a combined funeral service for Shane and Judy Boyle. If we can raise more than is needed for the service, any remaining funds would go to a charity that provides insulin to diabetics like Shane. We don't want other families to suffer the pain of losing a loved one because they couldn't afford medications. Thank you for any help you can provide, even if all you can offer is a kind message or sharing a special memory."" Vice also mentioned the circumstances surrounding Boyle's death in a story about the rising price of insulin. Long before Boyle launched a fundraising campaign, he worried about a Trump presidency's effects on the price of insulin. Immediately after the election, on November 9, 2016, Boyle wrote on Facebook: ""Last night/this morning, I was so depressed I did not want to live in this world anymore (and as a type one diabetic, I honestly don't know how long I will live if I lose access to affordable healthcare). Today, I feel more optimistic, not because I think everything is going to be okay, but because I have seen so many of your posts, recognizing the fight that is ahead, and talking about organizing, not just sitting back and complaining or planning for the next election.""",0

"The median income of a middle class family went down $2,100 from 2001 to 2007.",0
"Vice President Joe Biden visited a New Hampshire university on October 20, 2011, to promote President Barack Obama's American Jobs Act before an audience he referred to as the 9/11 generation. Speaking to a full house inside Plymouth State University's lecture hall, Biden discussed the need to restore the middle class and bring jobs back to America. He stated that middle-income Americans have been under siege long before the economic recession hit. ""In the previous decade, before the current recession, the middle class was getting killed,"" said Biden. During that period, between 2001 and 2007, productivity of American workers increased by 20 percent, but the median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100. ""Did the median of middle-income households really take a $2,100 hit before the economy hit the fan?"" We looked into Biden's claim to find out. First, we contacted Biden's staff to determine which figures they were using to arrive at the $2,100 decrease in the median income for middle-class households. Tobin Marcus, Biden's deputy economic policy adviser, informed us that the vice president was referring to real median household income for working-age households. ""We're looking at the core wage-earning households as opposed to retirees,"" Marcus said. Working-age households are typically considered to be those headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54, and the median income was chosen to represent middle-income wage earners. Biden's office cited the Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year-ending data for 2000 and 2007. They stated that they compared inflation-adjusted numbers using the annual average increase column of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. We examined their numbers, and their calculations checked out. To be sure, we contacted Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership. He confirmed the calculations provided by Biden's campaign. ""I looked at the data sources, and they appear to be correct, and the data calculated correctly,"" Delay said. Delay then pointed us to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, which used the same data. From 2000 to 2007, the Institute reported that the real median income of working-age households fell from $61,574 in 2000 to $59,460 in 2007, a decrease of $2,114. The White House Task Force on the Middle Class cited a weak labor market and anemic job growth of the 2000s as some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 3.4 percent decline in the median of middle-class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession. ""Clearly, median inflation-adjusted income fell much faster during the recession (2007 to present),"" Delay said. ""But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion (2000 to 2007) is very troubling. I don't believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation-adjusted income."" Our ruling: Vice President Biden stated that the median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 from 2001 to 2007, and the numbers check out. We rate Biden's claim True.",0
