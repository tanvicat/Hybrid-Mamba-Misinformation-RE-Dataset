One academic has helpfully summed up that philosophical conflict as follows:,Finance,
"Shareholder theory asserts that shareholders advance capital to a companys managers, who are supposed to spend corporate funds only in ways that have been authorized by the shareholders.

"Did 50,000 'Freedom Convoy' Trucks Set Guinness World Record?",Finance,
The vast majority of truck drivers in Canada are vaccinated.,Finance,
"In January 2022, a number of trucks participated in a convoy across Canada to protest the country's requirement for cross-border truckers to be vaccinated for COVID-19. As videos of the so-called ""freedom convoy"" spread on social media, various claims emerged regarding the number of trucks involved in this event.",Finance,
"In January 2022, a number of trucks participated in a convoy across Canada in protest of the country's requirement for cross-border truckers to be vaccinated for COVID-19. As videos of the so-called ""freedom convoy"" spread on social media, so did a number of claims concerning just how many trucks were participating in this event.",Finance,
"The largest truck convoy on record was set in November 2020 in Cairo, Egypt. That convoy involved 480 trucks and stretched 7.5 km (4.6 miles).",Finance,
"Many Canadian news outlets have used the word ""hundreds"" to quantify the number of trucks in this convoy. The CBC, for example, reported: ""Hundreds of truckers set off from British Columbia to Ottawa on Sunday to protest a federal vaccine mandate despite the urging of the country's largest trucking federation to comply.""",Finance,
"On social media, the estimate of trucks involved in this convoy has grown by the tweet. A post from Fox News host Sean Hannity, for example, claimed that the freedom convoy consisted of 10,000 trucks.",Finance,
"The claim that 50,000 trucks are participating in this convoy appears to have originated with one of the protest's organizers. The organizers may not be the most reliable source for this figure, however, as they have reason to inflate these numbers.",Finance,
"According to the Canadian Trucking Alliance, the cross-border vaccine mandate would impact about 15% (or about 16,000) of the country's truckers. If the 50,000 truck claim is to be believed, that would mean that not only would every one of those 16,000 truckers have to participate in the event, but they'd also need to be joined by 34,000 additional trucks who weren't impacted by the mandate.",Finance,
"The Canadian Trucking Alliance said in a statement that the ""the vast majority of the Canadian trucking industry is vaccinated with the overall industry vaccination rate among truck drivers closely mirroring that of the general public. Accordingly, most of our nations hard-working truck drivers are continuing to move cross-border and domestic freight to ensure our economy continues to function.""",Finance,

"If you receive this congratulatory text message from ""Amazon"" on your phone, don't click that link!",Finance,
"If you received a text message purportedly from Amazon, chances are you are one of many recipients, and it is a scam. During March and April 2021, many Snopes readers reported receiving messages on their phones claiming they had won an AirPod or another device in a raffle.",Finance,
"Indeed, the link did not connect to an official Amazon webpage. According to Amazon, all of its web pages normally follow the same format, ending in amazon.com, for example: pay.amazon.com or aws.amazon.com.",Finance,
The Better Business Bureau (BBB) alerted users to this scam back in March. It warned that if you get a text message from a range of unknown numbers and with a suspicious link for collecting your item:,Finance,

"Around 5 p.m. EDT on March 16, 2021, a 21-year-old white man allegedly shot and killed eight people -- six of whom were Asian women -- at three Atlanta-area spas.",Finance,
"As word of the tragedy spread online, however, people flooded social media with messages of sympathy for the deceased. Many posts classified them as unknowing victims of the country's increasing xenophobia, given a surge of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S, or pervasive violence against women.",Finance,
"Among such posters was Aaron Rupar, a journalist at Vox. A couple of hours after the incident, for instance, he blamed former U.S.",Finance,
"Rupar was referring to Trump's repeated insistence on calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" -- going against widely accepted public health guidelines that warn against titling disease outbreaks after nations or regions of the world to eliminate stigmatization -- and 2020 hate crime statistics in 16 U.S. cities compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University.",Finance,
"The underlying claim was true  as authorities in the Atlanta area embarked on a manhunt to catch the suspect on the evening of March 16, Trump referred to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"" on Fox News.",Finance,
"Meanwhile, at 7 p.m. EDT, Trump called in for a phone interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, a recording of which Snopes obtained via the media outlet's website and is displayed below.",Finance,
"Throughout much of the interview, the former president lambasted his successor's approach to immigration, criticized election security, and took credit for the ongoing efforts to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to every American willing to get one. Then, at approximately the 5-minute mark, he said:",Finance,

"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville.",Finance,
"CNN also reported on the public appearance, including the following quote from the former president in its Oct. 8, 2019, story: I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital.",Finance,
"According to the nonprofit's website, the couple formed a partnership with Habitat for Humanity in the 1980s, and they have rallied ""thousands of volunteers and even celebrities"" to join the organization's cause since then. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Habitat for Humanity paused its so-called ""Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project,"" a reoccurring event during which the couple fundraises to build a grouping of homes somewhere.",Finance,

"And according to Stansberry & Associates, this remarkable, radical collapse of the United States monetary system and ""our normal way of life"" is going into effect in a mere matter of months (just like a similar recent conspiracy scare about the federal government's plan to eliminate 16 states from the U.S. in the very near future).",Finance,

Example: [Collected via Twitter, January 2015] If a Writer Falls in Love with you, You shall Never Die #ReadSomewhere #ReadSomewhere Gaonka6hhora (@Gaonka6hhora) February 9, 2015 February 9, 2015 Origins: In January 2015, Canadian musician Aubrey Drake Graham, better known as the rapper Drake, incorrectly attributed a viral Tumblr quote about a writer's falling in love to Mustafa the Poet when he posted the meme to his Instagram page: @mustafathepoet A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Jan 14, 2015, at 9:11 PM PST.",Finance,

Is Netflix Giving Away Free 1-Year Subscriptions Due to COVID-19?,Finance,
Phishing scams have proliferated on the internet since the start of the pandemic.,Finance,
"Snopes is still fighting an infodemic of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation.",Finance,
"Since the start of the COVID-19 coronavirus in the United States in March 2020, a scam has been circulating on the internet falsely informing viewers that streaming giant Netflix was offering a free one-year subscription due to the pandemic.",Finance,
"The text of the scam read, ""Due to the CoronaVirus pandemic worldwide, Netflix is giving some free pass for their platform during the period of isolation. Run on the site cause it will end quick!"" The post also included a link, which we cropped out because it is likely a phishing site.",Finance,
"Netflix is making no such offer, and in fact as of October 2020, it no longer even offered temporary free trials for potential subscribers.",Finance,
"In other Netflix-related scams, members of the public reported receiving emails and text messages from scammers posing as Netflix representatives, telling them they need to update their accounts.

Did Shane Patrick Boyle pass away due to his illness following successful fundraising for insulin via a crowdfunding campaign?,Finance,
Reports concerning a man who passed away shortly after starting a GoFundMe crowdsourcing campaign to raise money for insulin were met with some skepticism.,Finance,
"In February 2017, Shane Patrick Boyle started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for ""a month of insulin."" A few weeks later, he died after developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Although several local outlets reported on Boyle's death at the time, it wasn't until November 2017 that his story reached many readers, thanks in part to a Facebook post from United States Sen.",Finance,

"In addition to highlighting the sad circumstances surrounding Boyle's death, The Nation also pointed to Alec Raeshawn Smith, a 26-year-old who died in June after he lost his insurance and started to ration his insulin:",Finance,
"Dave Anthony (@daveanthony) November 24, 2017",Finance,
"Alec Raeshawn Smith was 26 years old at the time of his death; however, we have not been able to find anything to indicate that he had set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for insulin. (A fundraiser was set up after his death to cover funeral costs.) Shane Patrick Boyle, on the other hand, was older when he died, and he did set up a fundraiser for medication.",Finance,
"Smith passed away on 27 June 2017. In his obituary, his family asked for donations to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and encouraged everyone to sign a petition for affordable health care:",Finance,
"In lieu of flowers memorial donations may be given to Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, www.jdrf.org. We would also like to encourage everyone to go to www.jdrf.org and sign the Coverage 2 Control petition which will provide affordability, choice and coverage for people with Diabetes.",Finance,
"Ted Closson, a comic book artist and friend of Boyle's, wrote that Boyle was ""$50 shy of his goal"" for over two weeks:",Finance,
A second GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a memorial for Boyle and his mother also suggests that the fundraiser was short of the $750 goal at the time of Boyle's passing (emphasis ours):,Finance,
Vice also mentioned the circumstances surrounding Boyle's death in a story about the rising price of insulin.,Finance,
"Long before Boyle launched a fundraising campaign, he worried about a Trump presidency's effects on the price of insulin. Immediately after the election, on 9 November 2016, Boyle wrote on Facebook (emphasis ours):",Finance,
