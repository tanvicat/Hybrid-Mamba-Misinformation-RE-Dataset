# A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Approach for Misinformation Quantification

This repository provides the dataset and code used in the paper: “Beyond Transformers: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Approach to Quantify Misinformation for Multiclass Relation Extraction”


# Dataset Description

The released data consists of the curated multiclass relation extraction dataset for misinformation analysis across four domains:

1. Crime
2. Entertainment
3. Finance
4. Politics



# Models Used

1. Transformer models (BERT, DeBERTa, BERTweet, PoliBERTweet, FinBERT)
2. Mamba (state-space model)
3. Hybrid (DeBERTa + Mamba) with gated fusion
